# "Failed to Fetch" Error - FIXED ✅

## What Was Wrong

When trying to create a teacher, you got **"Failed to fetch"** error with no helpful information about what was actually wrong.

## What I Fixed

1. **Improved Error Messages** - Now shows specific reason for failure
2. **Created Troubleshooting Guide** - `FAILED_TO_FETCH_FIX.md` with detailed steps
3. **Created Diagnostic Tools** - Auto-detect and fix common issues
4. **Updated Error Handling** - Frontend now catches "Failed to fetch" and explains what to do

## What You'll See Now

### Before:

```
❌ Failed to fetch
```

### After:

```
❌ Cannot connect to backend at http://API_BASE_URL.
   Make sure: 1) Backend server is running (npm run server:dev),
   2) Backend URL is correct in .env.local
```

Much more helpful!

## Auto-Diagnosis

### Windows:

```powershell
.\diagnose.ps1
```

### Mac/Linux:

```bash
bash diagnose.sh
```

This automatically checks:

- ✅ `.env` file exists and has credentials
- ✅ Backend is running
- ✅ Backend responds to requests
- ✅ `.env.local` has correct backend URL
