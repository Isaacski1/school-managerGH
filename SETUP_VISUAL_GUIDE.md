# 📋 Teacher Creation - Step-by-Step Setup

## Step 1: Get Firebase Credentials (2 minutes)

```
Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
    ↓
Click your project (noble-care-management-system)
    ↓
Click ⚙️ Settings icon (top-left)
    ↓
Click "Service Accounts" tab
    ↓
Click "Generate New Private Key" button
    ↓
✅ JSON file downloads automatically
    ↓
Keep it safe!
```

---

## Step 2: Create .env File (1 minute)

In your project root (same folder as `server.js`), create a file named `.env`

```env
PORT=3001
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=noble-care-management-system
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=
```

Open the downloaded JSON file and copy everything between `{` and `}`

Paste it after `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=`

**Final result:**

```env
PORT=3001
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=noble-care-management-system
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"noble-care-management-system",...}
```

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies (1 minute)

```bash
npm install
```

This installs both frontend and backend dependencies.

---

## Step 4: Start Backend (30 seconds)

**Open Terminal 1:**

```bash
npm run server:dev
```

You should see:

```
Server running on port 3001
```

---

## Step 5: Start Frontend (30 seconds)

**Open Terminal 2:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/...
```

---

## Step 6: Test Teacher Creation (1 minute)

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
2. Log in as school admin
3. Go to Admin Dashboard → Manage Teachers
4. Click "Add Teacher" button
5. Fill in:
   - Full Name: `John Doe`
   - Email: `john@example.com`
   - Password: (leave empty or enter optional password)
6. Click "Create Teacher"
7. ✅ Should see success modal!

---

## Step 7: Deploy to Production (5 minutes)

### Deploy Backend to Render.com

1. **Create Account:** https://render.com (free)
2. **Click "New +" → "Web Service"**
3. **Connect GitHub:** Select your repo
4. **Configure:**
   - Name: `noble-care-academy-backend`
   - Runtime: `Node`
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Instance: `Free`
5. **Environment Variables:** Add
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=noble-care-management-system`
   - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={...paste JSON...}`
6. **Deploy!**
7. **Copy the URL:** Something like `https://noble-care-academy-backend.onrender.com`

### Update Frontend

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://noble-care-academy-backend.onrender.com
```

Backend verifies ID token is valid
    ↓
Backend checks user is school_admin or super_admin
    ↓
Backend validates email and password format
    ↓
Backend checks email doesn't already exist
    ↓
Backend creates Firebase Auth user
